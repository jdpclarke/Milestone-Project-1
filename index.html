                  the government helps adults fund their learning. They're for
                  higher-level qualifications (Level 3 and above, like A-levels
                  or diplomas). You borrow the money, and you don't have to pay

                  loans are an important part of the overall support for adults.

              Adult funding is available, but the specific benefits you can
              access will depend on your individual circumstances. Factors such
              as your age, prior qualifications, employment status, and the type
              of course you're interested in all play a role. Because of this
              variety, it's always a good idea to talk to a training provider or
              careers advisor to get personalised advice tailored to your
              situation.

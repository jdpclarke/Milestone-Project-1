### Design

- **Colour Scheme**

  When people hear the word funding, the most common association is simply money, as funding is the provision of financial resources. As such, the colour palette for this project has been sampled from a Â£20 note as sourced from the [Bank of England Specimen Image](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer-20-pound-note). The below colour palette was generated from the Front of the Queen Elizabeth II note using [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

  ![Colour palette for this project](Assets/README/Colour%20Palette.png)

- **Typography**

  The ["Rubrik"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font family has been selected as the main font used throughout the whole project with Sans Serif as the fallback font in any case that the font isn't being imported into the project correctly. Rubrik is a classified as a variable font which allow one font file to contain multiple variations. You can change the weight, width, style, optical size, and more. The variables within variable fonts are controlled by axes.

  The ["Righteous"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous) font family has been selected as the heading element font. Righteous is classified as a static font and is not as versitile as a variable font, hence why this is used for heading elements only.

### Imagery

This website utilises a variety of images to enhance the user experience and convey information effectively. The images serve several purposes:

- **Branding:** The logo (`Assets/Images/logo.png`) is used in the navigation bar to reinforce brand identity and provide a consistent visual element throughout the site.

- **Homepage Carousel:** The carousel on the homepage (`Assets/Images/index-carousel-1.svg`, `Assets/Images/index-carousel-2.svg`, `Assets/Images/index-carousel-3.svg`, `Assets/Images/guide-carousel-2.svg`, `Assets/Images/guide-carousel-3.svg`, `Assets/Images/guide-carousel-4.svg`, `Assets/Images/guide-carousel-5.svg`) features rotating images with accompanying text to highlight key information, promotions, or calls to action. These images are designed to be visually appealing and informative.

- **Informational Images:** Images are incorporated within the accordion sections (`Assets/Images/esfa-2.jpg`, `Assets/Images/asf.jpg`) and card components (`Assets/Images/esfa.jpg`, `Assets/Images/career-search.jpg`, `Assets/Images/ncs.webp`, `Assets/Images/funding-grants.jpg`) to illustrate concepts, break up text, and make the content more engaging. These images are carefully selected to be relevant to the surrounding information.

- **Favicon:** A favicon (`Assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png`, `Assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png`, `Assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png`) is included to provide a visual cue for the website in browser tabs and bookmarks. This also provides a first look in to the brand of the website.

All images used on the website are optimised for web performance to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience. Alternative text (alt text) is provided for all images to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments and to improve SEO. The alt text descriptions are concise and descriptive, accurately conveying the content and purpose of each image. For example, the carousel images have descriptive alt text explaining the message conveyed in each image. Similarly, the images in the accordion and card sections have alt text that describes the subject of the image.

## 4. Technology Used

This project, FE Funding 4 U (FF4U), was built using a combination of front-end web development technologies to ensure a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

- **HTML5:** HTML5 was used as the foundation for the website's structure and content. Semantic HTML5 elements were employed to create a logical and accessible document outline, improving both search engine optimization (SEO) and screen reader compatibility. The use of semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` clarifies the purpose of different parts of the page, making the content more understandable for both users and machines.

- **CSS3:** CSS3 was used for styling the website and controlling its visual presentation. Custom CSS rules were written in the `style.css` file to enhance and tailor the website's appearance beyond the default styles provided by Bootstrap. CSS classes were strategically applied to elements to manage layout, typography, colours, and spacing. This included the creation of custom classes for styling elements like bullet point lists and video wrappers.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript was used to implement interactive features. While the provided code primarily relies on Bootstrap's JavaScript for interactive components, future enhancements will incorporate more custom JavaScript. The inclusion of Bootstrap's JavaScript via CDN enables functionalities such as the collapsible navigation menu and accordion elements.

- **Bootstrap 5:** Bootstrap 5, a popular front-end framework, was utilized to create a responsive and mobile-first design. Bootstrap's grid system facilitated the creation of a flexible layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Pre-built components, such as navigation bars, cards, and accordions, were used to accelerate development and ensure consistency in the user interface. The framework's built-in responsive utilities and CSS classes were used extensively to manage the website's responsiveness. The dark theme functionality was also utilized.

- **Font Awesome:** Font Awesome icons were integrated into the website to enhance visual appeal and improve user experience. Icons were used to represent different sections and concepts, making the content more engaging and easier to understand. The use of icons also contributes to a more intuitive navigation experience.

- **Google Maps API (Embedded):** The Google Maps API was used to embed a map of the organization's location within the footer. This enhances user experience by providing a visual and interactive way to locate the organization's physical address.

- **YouTube Embed (iFrame):** Although the included source is a placeholder, the website is designed to embed youtube videos using iFrames. This allows for the integration of video content to further explain and enhance the website's information.

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript were loaded from a CDN. This allows for faster loading times as it uses servers geographically closer to the user.

**2. Automated Testing:**

- **HTML and CSS Validation (W3C):**
  The website's HTML was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and the CSS was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
  
  The results for each page can be found below:
  - [Home Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjdpclarke.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Findex.html)
  - [Your Guide Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjdpclarke.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Fguide.html)
  - [Help Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjdpclarke.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Fhelp.html)
  - [Form Success Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjdpclarke.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Fform-success.html)
  - [Website CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjdpclarke.github.io%2FMilestone-Project-1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

  This ensured that the code adhered to web standards and was free from syntax errors. Any identified errors were corrected to improve the site's overall quality and consistency.

  W3C Markup Validation has highlighted a multitude of info messages relating to "Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values." These are in place due to the prettier formatter - any attempts to remove them and re-format add the slashes back in to the code.

  W3C CSS Validation has highlighted 433 warnings with the website. 434 relate to the bootstrap CSS and is out of the developers control. The remaining 9 refer to the custom CSS variables that have been declared. The validator acknowledges that CSS variables introduce a level of dynamism that's beyond the scope of its static analysis.

- **Performance, Best Practices, and SEO Testing (Lighthouse):**
  - Lighthouse, within the Chrome Developer Tools, was used to evaluate the website's performance, best practices, and SEO. This testing provided insights into areas for optimization, such as image compression and page load speed. The results of the Lighthouse testing were used to make targeted improvements to the site's performance and search engine visibility. Whilst the mobile analysis provided a near perfect score, the desktop version proved to be less than ideal.

  - **Lighthouse Performance Analysis:**

    A Lighthouse audit was conducted, revealing a strong performance score of 93 and excellent Best Practices (100) SEO (100). However, the audit highlighted opportunities to improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which was 5.6 seconds, and optimize image handling. Lighthouse suggested:

    - Serving images in next-gen formats.
    - Properly sizing and efficiently encoding images.
    - Eliminating render-blocking resources.
    - Improving caching of static assets.

    These optimizations would enhance performance, particularly by reducing the LCP, and improve user experience. However, upon investigation, this was relating to a lot of the Bootstrap CSS which is outside of the developers control.

  - **Accessibility Considerations:**

    The accessibility score of 96 indicates a contrast ratio issue, specifically with the body section on the website and the secondary colour in the CSS . This could be addressed to improve accessibility for all users, especially those with visual impairments. Further investigation into color contrast ratios could be conducted, and alternative color combinations explored to meet WCAG guidelines. At this moment in time, there are no plans to resolve this issue as whilst this presents a lower than desired score, the contrast is still sufficient and functional.
  
  - **Overall:**

    The website performs well, demonstrating strong SEO and a high performance score. However, improvements in LCP and accessibility are recommended. Addressing the identified contrast ratio issue and optimizing image handling could enhance the website's overall quality and user experience. While the site is functional, these improvements could ensure a more inclusive and performant web experience.

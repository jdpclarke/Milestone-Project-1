    -   #### Colour Scheme
        When people hear the word funding, the most common association is simply money, as funding is the provision of financial resources. As such, the colour palette for this project has been sampled from a Â£20 note as sourced from the [Bank of England Specimen Image](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer-20-pound-note). The below colour palette was generated from the Front of the Queen Elizabeth II note using [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)
        
        ![Colour palette for this project](https://github.com/jdpclarke/Milestone-Project-1/blob/a2c8f37c5d7a062c29b87db03c4eda8f13876bf4/Assets/README/Colour%20Palette.png)
    -   #### Typography
        The ["Rubrik"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font family has been selected as the main font used throughout the whole project with Sans Serif as the fallback font in any case that the font isn't being imported into the project correctly. Rubrik is a classified as a variable font which allow one font file to contain multiple variations. You can change the weight, width, style, optical size, and more. The variables within variable fonts are controlled by axes.

        The ["Righteous"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous) font family has been selected as the heading element font. Righteous is classified as a static font and is not as versitile as a variable font, hence why this is used for heading elements only.

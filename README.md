## 1. Overview

FE Funding 4 U (FF4U) is a website designed to simplify the often-complex process of finding funding for Further Education courses in England. It targets adults who are considering returning to education or upskilling but are unsure about the financial support available. The site provides clear information about the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), the Adult Skills Fund (ASF), various funding models (fully funded, co-funded, loans), and links to key resources. The goal is to empower users to explore their funding options and confidently embark on their learning journey.

This project focuses on creating a responsive and user-friendly website with a clear information architecture. It addresses accessibility considerations and follows best practices for web development.

- ### Design

  - **Colour Scheme**

    When people hear the word funding, the most common association is simply money, as funding is the provision of financial resources. As such, the colour palette for this project has been sampled from a Â£20 note as sourced from the [Bank of England Specimen Image](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer-20-pound-note). The below colour palette was generated from the Front of the Queen Elizabeth II note using [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/)

    ![Colour palette for this project](https://github.com/jdpclarke/Milestone-Project-1/blob/a2c8f37c5d7a062c29b87db03c4eda8f13876bf4/Assets/README/Colour%20Palette.png)

  - **Typography**

    The ["Rubrik"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font family has been selected as the main font used throughout the whole project with Sans Serif as the fallback font in any case that the font isn't being imported into the project correctly. Rubrik is a classified as a variable font which allow one font file to contain multiple variations. You can change the weight, width, style, optical size, and more. The variables within variable fonts are controlled by axes.

    The ["Righteous"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous) font family has been selected as the heading element font. Righteous is classified as a static font and is not as versitile as a variable font, hence why this is used for heading elements only.

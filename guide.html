                  Let's break down adult skills funding (ASF) and what it means
                  for you. The government helps adults gain valuable
                  qualifications through full funding, meaning you might be able
                  to study for free! Essentially, the government wants to help
                  adults improve their skills. There are several ways you can
                  get funding, so it's worth exploring your options. Don't
                  hesitate to ask for help from a training provider or careers
                  advisor to find the best path for you. There are some key
                  areas where you could get full funding:
                </p>
                <ul class="ms auto bullets">
                  <li>
                    <strong>English and Maths: </strong>If you're 19 or older
                    and haven't achieved a GCSE grade A* to C (or grade 4 or
                    above) in English or maths, you can study these subjects up
                    to Level 2 for free. Even if you have GCSEs but your skills
                    are below a Grade 4, you can also access this funding.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>First Level 2 Qualification (Aged 19-23): </strong
                    >If you're between 19 and 23 and this is your first full
                    Level 2 qualification, it's likely to be fully funded.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>First Level 3 Qualification (Aged 19-23): </strong
                    >Similarly, if you're 19 to 23 and this is your first full
                    Level 3 qualification, it should also be fully funded.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Digital Skills: </strong>If you're 19 or older and
                    your digital skills are below Level 1, you can improve them
                    for free with Essential Digital Skills Qualifications
                    (EDSQs) or Digital Functional Skills qualifications (DFSQs)
                    up to Level 1.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Other Opportunities: </strong>Depending on your
                    situation (like being unemployed or earning below a certain
                    amount), you might also be able to get full funding for
                    courses that help you get a job, local courses, HGV
                    licences, work placements, and some programs like SWAPs and
                    The Prince's Trust. ESOL (English for Speakers of Other
                    Languages) courses may also be fully funded.

                    <strong>Only one at a time: </strong>If you're 19 or older
                    and haven't achieved a GCSE grade A* to C (or grade 4 or
                    above) in English or maths, you can study these subjects up

                  <li>
                    <strong>Talk to someone: </strong> Because everyone's
                    situation is different, it's really important to get advice
                    from a training provider or careers advisor. They can tell
                    you exactly what funding you're eligible for and what
                    courses are available. They can also help you plan your next
                    steps after you finish your qualification.

                          it will be "co-funded," meaning you'll likely have to

                          skills, the government can help. This funding is
                          available for adults, and it can help you get
                          qualifications at Level 3.

                          approved courses on the government's website (it's

                          provider, and they can help you find it. They'll also
                          be able to tell you which courses are on the "legal

                <p class="card-text">
                  The ESFA Adult Skills Fund (ASF) often uses an earnings
                  threshold to determine eligibility for full funding of £25,000
                  per annum. This threshold is a specific income level, and
                  learners earning below it may qualify for fully funded
                  courses. The exact threshold amount varies and is subject to
                  change, so it's crucial to check the latest government
                  guidance or consult with a training provider for the most
                  up-to-date figures. Meeting the earnings threshold is just one
                  of several criteria, and other factors, such as age and prior
                  qualifications, also play a role.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Employment status is a key factor in determining eligibility
                  for ESFA Adult Skills Fund (ASF) funding. While some fully
                  funded courses are available regardless of employment status
                  (especially for learners aged 19-23 pursuing their first Level
                  2 or 3 qualification), many courses target individuals who are
                  unemployed or facing redundancy. The specific eligibility
                  criteria regarding employment status can vary depending on the
                  course and funding stream, so it's best to speak with a
                  training provider to understand the requirements for a
                  particular course.

                  To be eligible for ESFA Adult Skills Fund (ASF) funding,
                  learners must meet UK residency requirements. Generally, this
                  means being ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of
                  learning. There are specific rules and exceptions, so it's
                  essential to check the detailed residency criteria on the
                  government website or speak to a training provider for
                  individual circumstances. Residency requirements may vary
                  depending on nationality, immigration status, and length of
                  stay in the UK.

              Adult funding is available, but the specific benefits you can
              access will depend on your individual circumstances. Factors such
              as your age, prior qualifications, employment status, and the type
              of course you're interested in all play a role. Because of this
              variety, it's always a good idea to talk to a training provider or
              careers advisor to get personalised advice tailored to your
              situation.
